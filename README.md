# Deep-Learning-and-Computer-Vision-A-Z-OpenCV-SSD-GANs

There are some introductions and headups I would like to share when I'm studying this course,
hope it can save you some time when applying these projects:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 1: Frontal face recognition project using Haarcascade for eyes and face.
In the homework, a smile detector was added for human faces and cat face detection
was applied. 
env setup: Everything should work with the most recent Anaconda packages with python 3.7 etc.
Please don't struggle with the course installation yml file. It's too outdated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 2: Funny_dog.mp4 is the input video for SSD neural network to detect human and a 
moving dog.

env setup: Partial code might not be compatible with the most updated Anaconda packages. But
it worked fine on old version of Anaconda 3 1.6.8, python 3.6, pytorch 1.0.0, torchvision 0.2.1
and imageio 2.2.0.
